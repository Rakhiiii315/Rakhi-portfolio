    <p>
      Hi, I'm <strong>Rakhi</strong> 👋 — an Electronics & Communication Engineering student deeply passionate 
      about <strong>IoT, automation, and embedded systems</strong>. I enjoy designing smart solutions that connect 
      hardware and software, bringing everyday ideas to life through technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey so far has included hands‑on work with <strong>sensors, Arduino Nano programming, solar power 
      integration, and computer vision</strong>. These projects have strengthened my ability to build efficient, 
      real‑world systems that merge innovation with practicality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond technical skills, I thrive in <strong>collaborative teamwork</strong> and love experimenting with 
      layouts, gradients, and branding choices that reflect my personality. I’m motivated, enthusiastic, and excited 
      to keep learning and applying my skills to impactful engineering projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      🌟 <em>My short‑term goal:</em> Launch a recruiter‑ready portfolio site that highlights my projects, skills, 
      and creativity — opening doors to industry opportunities in IoT and embedded systems.
