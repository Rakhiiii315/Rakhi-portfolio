    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a final-year Electronics & Communication Engineering student with a strong interest in embedded systems, IoT, and hardware–software integration. I enjoy building practical, sensor‑based systems and exploring how circuits and code come together to solve real-world problems. My approach is methodical and experiment-driven — I like breaking problems into steps, testing each stage, and creating reliable embedded solutions. As part of IEEE Eureka 2025, my team ranked among the top 15 in India, giving me valuable experience in innovation, teamwork, and national-level technical collaboration. I’ve also contributed to STEM outreach by conducting hands-on electronics workshops for school students, helping them explore technology in an engaging and practical way.
